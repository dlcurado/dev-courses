# Daniel Lourenço Curado – Dev Playground

Welcome to my coding playground! This repository is a living collection of hands-on studies, architectural experiments, and technical practices using a variety of technologies.

As an experienced Agile Coach transitioning back into hands-on software development, I use this space to deepen my technical skills, explore software architecture patterns, and document my learning journey.

Whether you're here to explore clean architecture, Dockerized environments, or projects with .Net, Go, Node.js and much more — you're in the right place.


## Repository Structure
/
 ├── DotNetCoreSimpleApi           # Minimalist .NET Core Simple API with Clean Architecture
 ├── codeflix-catalog-dotnet       # DDD-style .NET catalog API (study of architecture & patterns for FullCycle course)
 ├── docker                        # Labs with Docker, Go, Node.js & cloud integrations (this is from FullCycle too)
 ├── README.md                     # You're here :)


Each project is self-contained with its own README, architecture notes, and usage guide.

## Purpose of This Repository

- Practice software architecture (Clean Architecture, SOLID, Domain-Driven Design)
- Showcase technical skills and hands-on development in .NET and other stacks
- Serve as a personal lab for studies, prototypes, and career reskilling
- Support my transition into new opportunities, especially international freelancing roles

---

## Technologies in Use

- .NET 8+ and ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- xUnit and FluentAssertions for testing

## Notes from the Developer

Many of these projects are in progress. Some features may be missing or still under construction — and that’s the point. I use this space to build in public, track my growth, and learn better through real code.

If you're reviewing my work, I welcome any kind of feedback or tips. Feel free to fork, suggest, or open issues.

## Let’s Connect

I’m open to new professional opportunities — especially freelance or remote collaborations focused on high-quality, maintainable backend systems.
